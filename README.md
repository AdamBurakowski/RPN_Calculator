# RPN_Calculator
This is a Calculator, which takes RPN as input, and computes the equation

The program still has couple of bugs, but as long as your equation is written
correctly, it should compute it correctly, and if you fail either my program
or python will give you an error.

It can add, subtract, multiply, divise, mod, and rise to the power.
It also handles negative numbers.

I might add more operations if I get a cool idea, on how to implement them.
